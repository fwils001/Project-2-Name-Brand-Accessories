# Project-2-Name-Brand-Accessories

This is my e-commerce site that is an extension of my eBay store. I already have 235 positive reviews, I have 54 followers, and I have been selling on the site since 2000. I wanted a place to sell my items without having to take a loss on my profits anymore by being forced to use eBay as the middle man.

This app has a models folder with the information stored in an accessories.js file. There is also an index page, a show page for each item, and a checkout page for the buyer. Items are edited by me in the database directly. I also have a views folder with index.ejs and show.ejs.

Index route: /accessories
Show page: /accessories/:id
Checkout page: /accessories/checkout
