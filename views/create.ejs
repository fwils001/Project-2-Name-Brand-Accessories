    <h2>Thank you for visiting my site! I have a nice collection of designer items for sale. Many of these items I purchased for myself. But, as we all know, people grow tired of wearing the same things over and over again. That's why I'm here now. I want to give you the pleasure of owning these beautiful items as well.</h2>
